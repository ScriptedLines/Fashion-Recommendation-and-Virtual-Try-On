# 👗 Virtual Try-On (VTON) & Clothing Recommendation Model

This repository contains the implementation of a **Virtual Try-On (VTON)** system combined with a **clothing recommendation model**. It provides an interactive interface to try on clothes virtually and receive recommendations based on clothing attributes.

## 🔗 Checkpoints
Pre-trained model checkpoints are available **[here](<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p3MM7GfNOGZgKUMmjPXZbnZ-o1SsOdVW?usp=sharing>)**.

After downloading, place them in: checkpoints folder in VTON-Model folder


## 📦 Dataset
